## Example pitches
Here are also two example pitches, so you get the idea of what they should look like:

**Example 1:**

Everyone loves pets, so why on earth would you pay someone to pet sit, why not have them pay you! 

Next time you’re going on holiday, match with a local petless pet lover to ensure your pet is pampered while you’re away. 

<br>

**Example 2:**

Finding a compatible companions for your canine can be tricky, there’s so many different breads with different behaviours that might not mesh with your furry friend 

With our App Companion Pup, you can take a picture of a local dog and detect its bread to find out key characteristics and to see if they’re your dog’s new BFF!
